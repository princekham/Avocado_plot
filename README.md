18 ft x 20 ft
Total no of plants = 30 plants

The no of 25 mm pipe needed = (18ft x 4 = 72 ft) for three rows and (18 x 2) = 36 ft for two rows = 99 ft
Total no of 16 mm pipe needed (5 x 5 x 20 ft) = 500 ft

So 16mm - 5 unit (100ft) = 65000 MMK (300 ft) x 2 = 140000 MMK
25 mm - 1 unit (100 ft) = 130000 MMK
Total - 270000 MMK
